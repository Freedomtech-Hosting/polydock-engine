Polydock Engine is a Laravel-based application management and deployment platform that enables organizations to offer self-service trials and deployments of their applications on top of [Lagoon](https://www.lagoon.sh) platforms (such as [amazee.io](https://www.amazee.io)). While Lagoon empowers developers to use Kubernetes without deep technical knowledge, Polydock Engine focuses on enabling non-technical users to deploy and manage multiple instances of the same application through a user-friendly interface.
