- Are patient with our response times (we try our best!)
- Help us by writing clear documentation and tests
- Start with small, focused contributions to get familiar with the codebase

## Questions?

Feel free to contact the project maintainers if you have any questions or need help with your contribution. While we're a small team and may not respond immediately, we do our best to review all contributions and provide constructive feedback.

## Development Resources

Since we're a small team, we've tried to document everything clearly to help you get started:
- The README.md contains detailed setup instructions
- Our code is heavily commented to explain our design decisions
- We use type hints and docblocks extensively
- Test coverage helps demonstrate intended behavior

Thank you for understanding our constraints as a small team and for your interest in contributing to Polydock Engine!
